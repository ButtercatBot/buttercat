# Spotify Requests Plugin

A plugin that listens to the chat of a given Twitch stream for messages with a Spotify song link in them and then
adds that song to a playlist and/or your queue. The Spotify link must be at the start of the message in order to be
picked up.

[Check out the docs for instructions on how to set up as a plugin or as a standalone bot.](https://buttercat.dev/plugins/spotify-requests)
