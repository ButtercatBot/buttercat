Once you've got your bot connected to Twitch, you'll want to add some functionality to it.
This is where plugins come in.
Plugins are small pieces of code that add functionality to your bot.
They can do anything from playing music to telling your chat when it's a raining outside.

## Adding a Plugin

Adding a plugin is easy, for this example we'll be adding `example-plugin`, but you can add any plugin you want.

1. Install the plugin with `npm install example-plugin`
2. Call `addPlugin` on your bot instance and pass in the plugin

   <br />
   <Alert>
   	<Info size={16} />
   	<AlertTitle>Note</AlertTitle>
   	<AlertDescription>
   		Some plugins require additional configuration, check the plugin's
   		documentation for more information.
   	</AlertDescription>
   </Alert>

   ```ts
   import { Bot } from '@buttercatbot/core';
   import examplePlugin from '@buttercatbot/example-plugin';

   await new Bot({
   	channels: ['mychannel'],
   	identity: {
   		username: 'mytwitchusername',
   		password: 'mytwitchtoken',
   	},
   	logLevel: 2,
   })
   	.addPlugin(examplePlugin)
   	.initialize();
   ```

3. Start your bot and check that the plugin is loaded. You should see a message in your console.
4. You're done! You can now use the plugin.
5. If you want to add more plugins, you can chain `addPlugin` calls to add as many as you want

   ```ts
   import { Bot } from '@buttercatbot/core';
   import examplePlugin from '@buttercatbot/example-plugin';
   import examplePlugin2 from '@buttercatbot/example-plugin-2';

   await new Bot({
   	channels: ['mychannel'],
   	identity: {
   		username: 'mytwitchusername',
   		password: 'mytwitchtoken',
   	},
   	logLevel: 2,
   })
   	.addPlugin(examplePlugin)
   	.addPlugin(examplePlugin2)
   	.initialize();
   ```
