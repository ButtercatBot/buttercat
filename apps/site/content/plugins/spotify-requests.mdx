A plugin that listens to the chat of a given Twitch stream for messages with a Spotify song link in them and then
adds that song to a playlist and/or your queue. The Spotify link must be at the start of the message in order to be
picked up.

✔️ Message that WOULD be picked up:

    `!prefix https://open.spotify.com/track/4uLU6hMCjMI75M1A2tKUQC pls play this, it's a bop`

❌ Message that WOULD NOT be picked up:

    `!prefix this is a bop can you please play this https://open.spotify.com/track/4uLU6hMCjMI75M1A2tKUQC`

## Setup

### Spotify

- Go to the [Spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
  and create a new application. The app can have whatever name and description you want

- Once the app is created, click on Edit Settings and add a redirect URL of
  `http://localhost:8000/spotifyAuth` (or whatever port you set in the plugin settings)

- The playlist ID can be found by either:

- Right-clicking on the playlist -> clicking Share -> Copy Spotify URI and then copying the ID
  after `spotify:playlist:`
  e.g. `spotify:playlist:{THIS_STRING_IS_THE_ID}`)

- Or by right-clicking on the playlist -> clicking Share -> Copy Link to Playlist and then copying the ID
  after `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/` and before the `?si=`
  e.g.

  ```text
  https://open.spotify.com/playlist/{THIS_STRING_IS_THE_ID}?si=12345123
  ```

- If you have `addToQueue` toggled on, ensure you have the Spotify client open and that it is active (i.e. is playing
  a song)

- If there's a problem with Spotify authorization at any point, try deleting the
  `spotify-auth-store.json` file and starting the app again

### Chat

If you wish to have chat feedback, you require a token which you can generate at
[https://twitchapps.com/tmi/](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)

You must also set the bot username to the name of the account you wish to use (must be the same account you
generate the
OAuth token for)

    const plugin = SpotifyRequestsPlugin({
   	 commandPrefix: string,
   	 spotify: {
   		 clientId: string;
   		 clientSecret: string;
   	 },
   	 authServer: {
   		 port: number;
   		 host: string;
   	 }
    });

    await myBot.addPlugin(plugin).initialize();
   ```

### Standalone

1. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

2. Clone the repo and navigate to the `plugins/spotify-requests` directory

3. Run `npm install`

4. Follow the steps in the [Setup](#setup) section

5. Create a `./.env` file based on `./.env.template` file and fill in the fields

6. Run `npm run start-standalone` to start the bot

7. Open the authorization link and give the app the required permissions

8. Type a Spotify link in the chat (ensuring the link is the first piece of text in the message)
   and make sure it shows up in your desired playlist (Spotify links should start
   with `https://open.spotify.com/track/`)
